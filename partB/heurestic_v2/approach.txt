the shortest path procedure with time complexity of n^2

scan every piece on board:
if empty or opponent: len of shortest path = infinite

else if players piece:
    shortest path is calculated by expanding in circles with current piece in centre,
    using an internal board to record distance of each coord:
for neighbours from degree 1 to n
    if players piece is encountered:
        value = prev_radius

    elif opponent piece is encountered:
        value = inf

    else:
        value = radius
